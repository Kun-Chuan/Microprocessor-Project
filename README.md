# Microprocessor-Project

In this project, we are designing, simulating, and implementing a simple 16-bit microprocessor with a custom instruction set using Quartus II and Verilog. 


The micro-architecture and custom ISA can be found in the files "Microprocessor Whole Schematic.pdf" and "Instruction_encoding.pdf."
